## Introduction

This repository contais my custom [Fedora Atomic Desktop](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/) image, it bases of [Kinoite](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/kinoite) and uses the [image template](https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template) from the [Universal Blue project](https://universal-blue.org) to make changes to the image.

The name of this repo, and of this "OS" for that matter, is a wordplay with [Junitoite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junitoite), a [silicate mineral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicate_mineral) like [Kinoite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinoite), and my sibling's name.

## Attention, do NOT use this

This image is very basic and made for my personal usage and learning, it's not meant for general use. Feel free to take a look at the files and learn from it though, it's very beginner level and heavily commented on the "code" side, so it may be easy to learn somethings if you're just starting.
